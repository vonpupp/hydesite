My personal web site
===

This is the source code of my personal web site using Hyde, a static website
generator written in Python.

I use Travis CI for continuous delivery of this website. I automatically deploy
the website (i.e: compile and push to a gh-pages) to the repository if no
syntactic errors are found. Here is the status:

* Travis build status (master branch): [![Build
Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/vonpupp/hydesite/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/vonpupp/hidesite)

* Travis build status (develop branch): [![Build
Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/vonpupp/hydesite/develop.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/vonpupp/hidesite)

I use Waffle to keep track of the issues as the posts/topics I want to research
in a neat Kanban. Here is the current status and the throughput graph.
