## Intro

{% block excerpt %}
{% mark excerpt %}

On my prior post I showed how to [setup Hyde]. This is the next post of the
[Hyde series] in which I will show how to [setup a multi-language site with
Hyde].

{% endmark %}
{% endblock %}

I want acknowledge that I have taken some parts from the setup of [Vincent
Bernat] and thank [Lakshmi] for his great help, support and patience helping me
out with the multi-language support.

## Installation

If you have followed my previous post, you are familiar that I have separated
the example into two repositories, one contains the `template` to be used and
the other contains the `content` itself. I will use the same repositories but in
different tags.

{% syntax bash %}
# Clone the template repository
# Clone the content repository
# Create a virtualenv
# Install the pip dependencies
# Build the website
{% endsyntax %}

## Explanation

I will explain the details of the parts to understand how it works. The folder
structure within the `content` folder is as follows:

{% syntax bash %}
# Get the folder tree
{% endsyntax %}

### The `Content` folder

As you can see, the main `index.html` only runs a script to detect the browser
language an redirect to the appropriate language version of the website. If the
browser language does not match an existing language it will fallback to the
default which is English.

This folder also contains the `media` folder which will hold the CSS,
fonts, images and Javascript files.

### The `Language` folders

As you can see within the root `content` folder there is a language folder for
each language you want to use. For simplicity I used only two letters language
coding standard (`en`, `es`, `pt`, etc). Within each language folder is the
structure of the website itself (the `sections`).

### The `Sections` folders

Within each language you will find the structure of the website where each section is
a folder.

The root folder must contain a `meta.yml` file that describes:

- From which template `extends` from (base.j2),
- The `language` of this section,
- And some of the basic localization (`l10n`) translation strings.

Each section must also contain a `meta.yml`. This is easier and it contains:

- The section `title`.
- From which template `extends` from,

Of course you can tailor this to your needs, to add for instance an icon for
each section or split the localization another level or any other information
used by that section. The limit is your imagination.

### The `site.yaml` file

Now that you are familiar with the folder structure and files for each language
we will see how to link everything together on the `site.yaml` file. You can
find this file on the root of the project (parent of the `content` folder).

Among the basic sections of every Hyde project this file must use the
`hyde.ext.plugins.languages.LanguagePlugin`.

If you have a blog and you need to parse the tags, then you will have to
include the `tagger` section and the `archives` section within it (`tagger.archive` for
short). Inside you need to include the following block (per each language):

{% syntax bash %}
atom_en:
  source: en/blog
  target: en/tags
  template: tag.xml.j2
  extension: xml
blog_en:
  source: en/blog
  target: en/tags
  template: tag.j2
  extension: html
{% endsyntax %}

## Conclusions

The resulting website is plain HTML + Javascript + CSS, so it can be hosted
anywhere easily. You can use Github pages for so or even run your own webserver.

If you have followed this tutorial you might think that Hyde is just amazing. If
so, I would encourage you to get involved in the [Hyde community], we can help
you out, and of course you can help us out =).

For the time being I want to keep the [Hyde series] short and I will end this
tutorial here. The next tutorial will show how to setup a [multilanguage site
with Hyde].

## TODOs

- [ ] Check how to have only **one** Master DB and all the Slaves also sync the DB
from the master
- [ ] Use reflector commands within Powerpill
